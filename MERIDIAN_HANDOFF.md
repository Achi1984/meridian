# MERIDIAN HANDOFF

## Frozen / protected references
- Frozen legacy dashboard: `archive/v7.65-dashboard-frozen-20260905` at `8ddca55f194fb517a244cd45ae142cf28e2a8fd4`.
- Pre-cutover production rollback branch: `archive/v8-r11-production-pre-cutover` at `bdfc64f8cf588d5b4c3d6a3f4daebf019b8e7749`.
- Baseline `6.2.0 / 6.2-SIGNAL-V1` remains frozen.
- Paper/live execution, sizing, risk, exits and ledgers remain unchanged; live trading remains disabled.
- `server.js` remains untouched by v8 frontend work.
- v7.63/v7.64 canonical portfolio contracts remain authoritative.

## Production status — v8 LIVE
- Production root redirects deterministically to `./v8-clean/`, preserving query string and hash.
- Previous production root remains preserved on `archive/v8-r11-production-pre-cutover` for rollback.
- iPhone validation completed across CENTER / DEPOT / TRADE / PAPER / MORE with no legacy renderer/view collision.
- Persistent read-token state remains valid on production.

## Clean architecture invariants
- Exactly five real root views: CENTER / DEPOT / TRADE / PAPER / MORE.
- One deterministic navigation; no hidden legacy buttons.
- No legacy renderer/view ownership inside `v8-clean/`.
- Explicit read-only adapters use backend/API contracts; never scrape legacy DOM for values.
- No research auto-promotion.

## Production validation snapshot — 2026-09-05
- CENTER: total `$27.313`; Market `RISK-ON / SHORT-SQUEEZE`; Risk `WATCH`; BTC-S30 buffer `8.99%`; next action targets SAFE `>=12%`; Best Opportunity `NO READY SIGNAL`.
- DEPOT: total `$27.313` = Spot `$26.417` + Trading/Bots `$896`; canonical history rendered; top positions coherent.
- TRADE: BTC-S30 critical bot `8.99%`; HBAR-L3 `27.33%`; XRP-L5 `40.65%`; three active bots; Trading Equity `$896`.
- PAPER: `RESEARCH ONLY`; Baseline remains reference; no automatic promotion/execution impact.
- MORE: Market/Forecast/Research/Diagnostics/Settings render inside the real MORE view; token remains connected.

## Clean R1–R11 summary
- R1 CENTER: native five-view shell, private dashboard adapter.
- R2 DEPOT: canonical `spot + trading`, private history only.
- R3 TRADE: lowest-buffer bot drives DANGER/WATCH/SAFE and one next action.
- R4 PAPER: protected research board, no auto-promotion.
- R5 MORE: real fifth view, no legacy overlay.
- R6 Pages API binding to Northflank gateway.
- R7 persistent local read-token + canonical spot fallback repair.
- R8 mobile visual polish.
- R9 production identity (`v8.0 · PROD`).
- R10 DEPOT ranges `4H · 1T · 1W` plus HIGH/LOW.
- R11 chart mobile polish.

## Clean R12 — TRADE detail upgrade
- PR #58 merged after Release Safety run #704; main merge commit `41c13f864fd0bc9804d614c72941caad94f9e226`.
- Read-only disclosure cards for each active bot.
- Critical bot opens by default; other bots remain collapsed.
- Detail fields: Current Price, Break-even, Liquidation Price, PnL, Investment and Buffer.
- Fixed ladder: `DANGER <8%`, `WATCH 8–12%`, `SAFE >=12%`.
- Explicit SAFE path shows remaining percentage points to 12% or already SAFE.
- On read failure the canonical compact TRADE card remains intact.

## Clean R13 — TRADE data hygiene
- Branch: `fix/v8-trade-data-hygiene-r13`.
- iPhone validation exposed backend placeholder zeros for BTC-S30 Break-even and Investment; these are not meaningful live values.
- R13 treats non-positive Break-even, Investment, Liquidation and Current prices as unavailable and renders `—` instead of fake `$0` values.
- PnL zero is accepted only when an actual PnL field is explicitly present on the protected bot object; missing/blank PnL stays unavailable.
- No backend contract change, no invented values, no execution writes.
- Trade detail module cache tag moves to `8.0-r13`.

## Current next steps
1. Run Release Safety on the exact R13 head and merge only if green.
2. Validate BTC-S30 detail on iPhone: Break-even and Investment placeholder zeros should display `—`; Current/Liq/Buffer remain real.
3. If the protected Pionex snapshot later exposes real Break-even/PnL/Investment values, consume them without changing the read-only UI contract.
4. Next product work: CENTER enrichment or PAPER compaction; no architecture rewrite.
5. Research remains isolated until evidence and explicit human approval justify promotion.

## Research isolation
- v7.86 Retest/Hold Breakout V2 remains research-only and separate.
- v7.79 prospective holdout remains locked/prospective.
- Meta Allocator remains research-only.
- No research result auto-promotes into Paper/live execution.
